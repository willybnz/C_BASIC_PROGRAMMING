## {PRIME GENERATOR} 

`PrimeGenerator` is a basic exercise that consists of implementing a function that displays all the prime numbers included in a given interval.

The function therefore takes two positive integers as parameters and is prototyped as follows:
```c
int prime_generator(int x, int y);
```
Here are some examples of expected results:

`[BlaackMaan@DESKTOP] : ./prime_generator 2 5 | cat -e`

`2$`

`3$`

`5$`

`[BlaackMaan@DESKTOP] : ./prime_generator 10 1 | cat -e`
`17$`
`19$`
`23$`
`29$`
